# Two unusual entities that spaCy identified were "old man" and "wound" in the
# first and fifth sentences, respectively. I did not expect spaCy to recognize
# these as entities because they are not proper nouns or named entities.
# However, spaCy was able to identify them as entities by using its contextual
# understanding of language and its knowledge of common nouns and verb phrases.
